# SOA Final project: Real-Time Scheduler Simulator

Made by Jaime Pablo Pérez Moro and Anabel Díaz Labrador.

# Description
In this project we have programmed a real-time scheduler simulator inspired by Cheddar.

We have used QT creator to make this project.

This simulation will be done by programing the Rate-monotonic algorithm.

## QT Creator
We have worked on version 6.0.2 although it can possibly run on version 5.
